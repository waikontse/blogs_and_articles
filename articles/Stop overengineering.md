Have you ever wondered whether you should keep developing further the code you are working on?
The questions that forms in your head of future scenarios where your code might not be enough?
Welcome to overengineering. But what does it actually mean to overengineer?
(inset quote here) [from webster/wikipedia]

From the definition above, it feels like when we think of future fail scenarios we notch ourselves to start overengineering. 
In the rest of the article you will find where overengineering can happen, guidelines to prevent overengineering and what you can do instead.
You might be thinking now, what's the difference between preventing and 'do this instead of' overengineering. 
There is a difference here between preventing and what we can pro-actively do.
Preventing is stopping us from overengineering in the first place, and pro-actively doing something to prepare us for future enhancements.

# On what levels can we over-engineer?


# Why do we overengineer?
## Defensive programming
## Scaling issues
## known unknowns



# How to prevent overengineering

# Key take-aways
1. Figure out the 'WHY' (goal) and 'WHAT' (requirements)
2. Prefer overengineering to underengineering
3. built-in fexibility and minimize impact of change (from impact change analysis)
4. Stay in the present, don't solve problems you think you might have in the future
5. Mind the scope creep
